A lightweight Alpine JS plugin that adds an `$overlap()` utility to detect when
DOM elements overlap each other.

## What It Does

- üîç Provides a global `$overlap()` method that returns `true` or `false` when
  checking if elements intersect
- üß© Simple to use API by calling `$overlap('#targetElement')` to detect element
  intersections

## Why Use It

- Create UI components that react to element overlaps
- Build drag-and-drop interfaces
- Position tooltips/dropdowns to avoid collisions
- Implement simple collision detection for interactive elements
